# Quantum-Neural-Networks-QNNs-for-Brain-Image-Analysis
Our project integrates Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) and OpenVINOâ„¢ Toolkit to create a highly efficient and precise brain image analysis system. We developed a hybrid model that combines quantum layers with classical neural networks to optimize feature extraction and segmentation tasks.
